# Hangman
(by Robyn Soar)

Hangman is a word game and runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.
It's a well-known childhood word game in which traditionally is played with two or more players, with one person choosing a word and setting up the game, and the other being the one to guess the letters one by one or the whole word at a time. Hangman has been made so the user can play against a computer who decides on a random word, keeps tally of used letters and guesses left available, as well as gives hints to the user or the hidden word.

## Key Project Goals

- To give a fun game experience to the user that they can keep coming back to.
- To allow users to play as a singlular person instead of needed another to set up the game.

## Target Audience

- The primary target audience for Hangman is 5+, whether as a learning platform to help the younger audience learn how to spell or to soliditfy learning, but also for all reading ages to be able to have fun with a game.
